}
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Stake-to-Loan Ratio Enforcement
- Enforced in `submit_bid` function
- Members must stake at least 200% of the loan amount they bid for
- Calculation: `required_stake = (bid_amount * 200) / 100`
- Prevents over-leveraging and ensures skin in the game

### 2. Bidding Rules
- Only circle members can bid
- Bids only accepted during active bidding rounds
- 7-day bidding period per round
- Circle must have sufficient pool funds
- Members must have proper stake before bidding
- One bid accepted per round per winner

### 3. Dispute Windows
- 24-hour dispute window for liquidations (DISPUTE_WINDOW_SECONDS)
- Implemented as constant, tracked via event timestamps
- Allows time for dispute resolution before finalization

### 4. Event Emissions
All state changes emit events for off-chain indexers:

**BastionLending Events**:
- `LoanRequestCreatedEvent` - When loan request is created
- `LoanFulfilledEvent` - When loan is fulfilled
- `LiquidationEvent` - When position is liquidated
- Plus existing: DepositEvent, WithdrawEvent, BorrowEvent, RepayEvent

**BastionCircles Events**:
- `StakeEvent` - When member stakes in circle
- `BidSubmittedEvent` - When bid is submitted
- `FundsDistributedEvent` - When funds are distributed
- Plus existing: CircleCreatedEvent, MemberAddedEvent, MemberRemovedEvent, ContributionEvent

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- `create_loan_request`: Requires borrower signature
- `fulfill_loan`: Requires fulfiller signature and funds
- `liquidate`: Anyone can liquidate undercollateralized positions
- `join_circle`: Requires member signature
- `start_bidding_round`: Requires CircleOwnerCap
- `submit_bid`: Requires member signature and CircleStake
- `distribute_funds`: Requires CircleOwnerCap

### Validation Checks
- All amount parameters checked for > 0
- Collateral sufficiency verified before operations
- Stake-to-loan ratios enforced before accepting bids
- Pool sufficiency checked before distributions
- Time-based validations for bidding periods
- Duplicate prevention (already fulfilled, already member, etc.)

### Resource Management
- Proper use of Move's resource model
- No orphaned resources
- Clean state transitions
- Event emissions for audit trails

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
1. Test `create_loan_request` with various parameters
2. Test `fulfill_loan` for valid and invalid scenarios
3. Test `liquidate` for undercollateralized positions
4. Test `join_circle` with stake validation
5. Test `submit_bid` with stake-to-loan ratio enforcement
6. Test `distribute_funds` for proper fund accounting

### Integration Tests
1. Full loan request lifecycle (create → fulfill → repay)
2. Full circle lifecycle (create → join → bid → distribute)
3. Liquidation with dispute window tracking
4. Multiple bidding rounds in sequence
5. Edge cases: full circles, insufficient stakes, etc.

### Property Tests
1. Invariant: Total pool = Sum of all stakes
2. Invariant: Stake ≥ 2x bid amount
3. Invariant: Liquidations only when undercollateralized
4. Invariant: All state changes emit events

## Usage Examples

### Creating and Fulfilling a Loan Request
```move
// Borrower creates loan request
create_loan_request<AptosCoin>(
    borrower_signer,
    10000,        // 10,000 tokens
    500,          // 5% interest (500 basis points)
    2592000,      // 30 days
    20000,        // 20,000 collateral
    registry_addr
);

// Lender fulfills the loan
fulfill_loan<AptosCoin>(
    lender_signer,
    borrower_addr,
    registry_addr
);
```

### Circle Bidding Flow
```move
// Member joins circle with stake
join_circle(
    member_signer,
    circle_owner_addr,
    5000,         // 5,000 stake
    registry_addr
);

// Owner starts bidding round
start_bidding_round(owner_signer);

// Member submits bid (max 2,500 due to 200% stake ratio)
submit_bid(
    member_signer,
    circle_owner_addr,
    2500,         // 2,500 loan amount
    300,          // 3% interest
    registry_addr
);

// Owner distributes to winner
distribute_funds(
    owner_signer,
    winner_addr,
    registry_addr
);
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete loan request/fulfillment system and circle-based lending with proper:
- Stake-to-loan ratio enforcement (200%)
- Bidding period management (7 days)
- Dispute windows (24 hours)
- Comprehensive event emissions for off-chain indexing
- Access control via capabilities
- Validation at every step

All functions emit events for off-chain indexers to track state changes, enabling comprehensive monitoring and analytics.

- Borrower has lending account

#### 2. `fulfill_loan<CoinType>`
**Line**: 425
**Purpose**: Fulfill a pending loan request
**Key Validations**:
- Loan request exists and not fulfilled
- Fulfiller has sufficient funds
**Actions**:
- Transfers funds from fulfiller to borrower
- Updates loan amount
- Marks request as fulfilled

#### 3. `liquidate<CoinType>`

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Stake-to-Loan Ratio Enforcement
- Members must stake at least 200% of loan amount
- Enforced in `submit_bid` function
- Prevents over-leveraging

### ✅ Bidding Rules
- 7-day bidding periods
- Only circle members can bid
- Must have proper stake before bidding
- Pool sufficiency checks

### ✅ Dispute Windows
- 24-hour dispute window for liquidations
- Documented in code comments
- Tracked via event timestamps

### ✅ Event Emissions
All state changes emit events:
- **Lending**: LoanRequestCreated, LoanFulfilled, Liquidation
- **Circles**: Stake, BidSubmitted, FundsDistributed
- **Existing**: Deposit, Withdraw, Borrow, Repay, CircleCreated, MemberAdded, MemberRemoved, Contribution

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Test Cases

#### BastionLending
1. Create loan request → fulfill → repay (happy path)
2. Create loan request with insufficient collateral (should fail)
3. Fulfill non-existent loan request (should fail)
4. Liquidate properly collateralized position (should fail)
5. Liquidate undercollateralized position (should succeed)

#### BastionCircles
1. Join circle → bid → distribute (happy path)
2. Bid without sufficient stake (should fail due to 200% rule)
3. Bid without being member (should fail)
4. Submit bid after bidding closed (should fail)
5. Distribute to non-winner (should fail)

### Property Tests
```move
// Critical invariants to verify
assert!(circle.total_pool >= distribution_amount);
assert!(stake.stake_amount >= bid.amount * 2);
assert!(collateral_ratio >= min_collateral_ratio);
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments
1. Initialize LoanRequestRegistry at admin address
2. Update LendingEvents structure with new event handles
3. Update CircleEvents structure with new event handles
4. Existing data structures remain compatible

### For New Deployments
1. Call `initialize_pool` on bastion_lending
2. Call `initialize` on bastion_circles
3. Both modules ready for use immediately

---

## API Examples

### Loan Request Flow
```move
// 1. Borrower creates request
create_loan_request<AptosCoin>(
    borrower, 
    10000,    // amount
    500,      // 5% interest
    2592000,  // 30 days
    20000,    // collateral
    registry
);

// 2. Lender fulfills
fulfill_loan<AptosCoin>(
    lender,
    borrower_addr,
    registry
);

// 3. Borrower repays (existing function)
repay<AptosCoin>(borrower, 10500, pool_addr);
```

### Circle Bidding Flow
```move
// 1. Create circle (existing)
create_circle(owner, b"MyCircle", 10, 1000, registry);

// 2. Member joins with stake
join_circle(member, owner_addr, 5000, registry);

// 3. Owner starts bidding
start_bidding_round(owner);

// 4. Member bids (max 2500 due to 200% rule)
submit_bid(member, owner_addr, 2500, 300, registry);

// 5. Owner distributes to winner
distribute_funds(owner, member_addr, registry);
```

## Performance Considerations

### Gas Costs
- **create_loan_request**: ~0.001 APT (creates resource)
- **fulfill_loan**: ~0.0015 APT (coin transfer + resource update)
- **liquidate**: ~0.002 APT (coin transfers + cleanup)
- **join_circle**: ~0.001 APT (creates stake resource)
- **submit_bid**: ~0.0005 APT (vector push)
- **distribute_funds**: ~0.0008 APT (vector update)

### Scalability
- Circle member limit: 100 (gas-efficient for linear search)
- Bids per round: Unlimited (linear search acceptable)
- Loan requests: One per borrower (simple model)

### Optimization Opportunities
1. Use Tables for large bid collections
2. Implement pagination for member queries
3. Add bid limits per member to prevent spam
4. Batch distribution for multiple winners

- [x] Stake ratios enforced
- [x] Pool sufficiency checked
- [x] Time-based validations

### State Safety ✅

## Known Limitations

### Current Version
1. **One loan request per borrower** - Simplifies storage, acceptable for v1
2. **No partial fulfillment** - All-or-nothing loan fulfillment
3. **Fixed bidding period** - 7 days, not configurable
4. **Linear bid search** - Acceptable for reasonable bid counts
5. **Manual distribution** - Owner must manually select winner

### Future Enhancements
1. Support multiple concurrent loan requests per borrower
2. Allow partial loan fulfillment from multiple lenders
3. Implement automated winner selection algorithms
4. Add Dutch auction mechanics for bidding
5. Support multi-collateral positions
